      <article>
        <p>Sung Jin-Woo started as an E-rank hunter known as the "World's Weakest." After receiving the System and completing deadly quests, he evolved into humanity’s strongest force. He defeated world-ending threats like:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Antares, the Monarch of Destruction — the strongest Monarch.</li>
          <li>Frost Monarch and Beast Monarch — elite chaos rulers.</li>
          <li>Hundreds of S-rank dungeon bosses, often solo.</li>
          <li>Held off millions of chaos beasts in the Monarch War.</li>
          <li>Saved Earth from extinction-level events multiple times.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>His army of shadows made him a one-man war machine capable of collapsing nations in silence.</p>

      <h2>Potential</h2>
      <article>
        <p>Jin-Woo’s potential was unlocked via the “Player System” built by Ashborn. This system had no upper limit, allowing infinite growth. After fusing with Ashborn, he achieved:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Immortality as a spiritual god-tier entity.</li>
          <li>Time travel via the Cup of Reincarnation.</li>
          <li>Strength rivaling or surpassing the Rulers.</li>
          <li>Existence beyond life and death cycles.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>He stands as Earth’s ultimate guardian — and potentially the multiverse’s too.</p>
